# A task is an action that is ran within the context of a project, and wraps
# around an npm or system command. Tasks that are defined here and inherited by all projects
# within the workspace, but can be overridden per project.
#
# This setting requires a map, where the key is a unique name for the task,
# and the value is an object of task parameters.
